"""Query-time retrieval over the knowledge store.

Embeds the query, runs a KB-scoped search (hybrid or vector-only per
AI Settings' search_type), and hydrates each hit from MariaDB (the source of
truth) for its text and provenance.

Permission model — the knowledge base is the boundary. KBs are admin-curated
(System Manager-only doctypes), bound to agents by admins, and the LLM cannot
widen the scope. Retrieval is therefore not re-checked per chunk against the
running user; the binding is the authorization. The two gates are: scoping is
fail-closed (an empty scope is refused, never widened to the whole store), and
only knowledge bases that currently exist and are enabled are searched, so
disabling a KB is a real off-switch.

Ported verbatim from `flow.knowledge.retriever` (`apps/flow/flow/knowledge/retriever.py`).
