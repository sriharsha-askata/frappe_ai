"""Character-based fixed-size chunking with overlap.

Sizes are character counts. Chunks break on whitespace where possible so a
word is not split across two chunks; text with no whitespace falls back to a
hard split at chunk_size.

Ported verbatim from `flow.knowledge.chunker` (`apps/flow/flow/knowledge/chunker.py`) —
pure function, no Frappe imports, nothing to adapt.
